# Project-3

• Brief description of the app and its purpose.

This app is to explore the SeoulBikeData.csv data. There are 4 pages: About page, Data Exploration page, Modeling page, and Data page. It shows numerical summaries, Graphical Summaries, three models, and data. 

The purpose of this app is to explore the SeoulBikeData.csv data, fit and predict with three supervised learning models.

• A list of packages needed to run the app.

I used these packages to run the app: shiny,readr,DT,tidyverse,dplyr,ggplot2,psych,caret,tree.

• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).

install.packages(c("shiny","readr","DT","tidyversey", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "psych", "caret", "tree"))

• The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.

shiny::runGitHub("Project-3", "lwang67", ref = "main", subdir = "/Project3/")
